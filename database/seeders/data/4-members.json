I also learned first-hand how to build from the ground up every function in a new organization, by bootstrapping a 100+ people strong business with highly effective marketing, sales, operations, financing and HR functions amongst others. \n\nI am very particular about quality, experience and value and try to combine them all in a unique company and product to bring to market.\n",

        "description": "As the CEO & Co-Founder of Aktivate, I am passionate about revolutionizing the scholastic sports management landscape. With a focus on digital transformation, our platform empowers athletic departments and schools to streamline their programs, benefiting student athletes and their families.\n\nDrawing upon my extensive experience as an entrepreneur, I have successfully navigated the realms of VC fundraising and bootstrapping. Prior to Aktivate, I played a significant role in the success of CareDox, where we transformed from a B2C company into the nation's leading digital health platform for K-12 public schools. This experience has provided me with invaluable insights and a deep understanding of the intersection between technology, healthcare, and education.\n\nAt Aktivate, I am dedicated to driving growth, overseeing business development efforts, and building high-performing organizations. Through strategic partnerships and innovative solutions, we are reshaping how schools manage their athletic programs and empowering student athletes to take control of their athletic journey.\n\nWith a specialization in sales and a proven track record in organizational development, I am committed to creating an impactful and sustainable future for Aktivate. Let's connect and explore how we can leverage technology to transform the scholastic sports industry and unlock the full potential of student athletes.\n",

        "description": "Barr Yaron is the founder of Women of Startup Nation, an organization devoted to advancing Israeli women in technology and entrepreneurship. She is also a technologist, early stage investor, and Sequoia scout. Barr grew up in the United States to two Israeli parents. After interning in a wide range of industries, from the White House to Wall Street to Beyonce’s digital team, she was drawn to technology for its fast pace of change and potential to move society forward. She always wanted to live in Israel and relocated from Silicon Valley to Tel Aviv in 2016 through her work as a data scientist at Facebook. In late 2016 she founded Women of Startup Nation, an online page dedicated to the incredible achievements and stories of Israeli women in tech. She has interviewed over 150 Israeli women in technology and shared their stories, growing the platform to 20K+ followers. This platform has partnered with organizations around the country to help them increase female applicant pipelines.\n \nIn summer 2019, Barr expanded Women of Startup Nation to co-found Women of Startup Nation Accelerator, a full-time program in partnership with Google for Startups with the goal of accelerating the success of female-founded startups. Outside of Women of Startup Nation, Barr works in product management, as an angel investor, and as a founding General Partner of a fund for startups coming from her Stanford class. She graduated with her B.A. in Applied Mathematics, Economics and Computer Science from Harvard College as a John Harvard Scholar and her MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business as an Arjay Miller Scholar.\n",
